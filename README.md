# AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) Prep

This repository serves as a structured study environment for the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam. It is organized to facilitate active recall and systematic review of the five official exam domains.

## Repository Structure

The content is divided into folders corresponding to the official exam guide:

*   **01_Fundamentals_of_AI_ML**: Core concepts, inference types, and standard ML algorithms.
*   **02_Fundamentals_of_Generative_AI**: Foundation models, tokens, and inference parameters.
*   **03_Applications_of_Foundation_Models**: RAG, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering.
*   **04_Guidelines_for_Responsible_AI**: Guardrails, bias detection, and compliance.
*   **05_Security_Compliance_Governance**: Shared responsibility, data protection, and audit logging.

## Methodology: Agentic IDE

This project demonstrates a novel use of **Antigravity (IDE)** as an adaptive study partner, creating a dynamic feedback loop rather than static notes:

*   **Live Synthesis**: Documentation is generated in real-time from official AWS sources.
*   **Adaptive Quizzing**: The agent analyzes `progress_log.md` to generate custom, harder questions targeting specific weak points (e.g., "Agents vs RAG").
*   **Active Tutoring**: Transforming the IDE from a code editor into a context-aware certification coach.

## Usage

1.  Review the `README.md` in a specific domain folder.
2.  Navigate to the `Quizzes` folder and complete the latest markdown quiz.
3.  Log the score and any missed concepts in `progress_log.md`.
